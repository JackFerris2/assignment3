// Went through the GitLab Tutorials on Fri Feb 28th
// Rough estimate of GitHub account creation Jan 15 2025.

1. Console output from step 3.C :

jackferris@MacBookAir assignment3 % git status       
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   docs/answers.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

2. Total commits in the repository:
 - Used command: 'git rev-list --count HEAD'
 - 9

3. Last modification date of README.md:

 - Used command: 'git log -1 --format=%cd -- README.md'
 - Fri Feb 28 14:34:21 2025 -0500

4. Two reasons branches are used:
 - Develop new features without affecting the main branch.
 - Allow multiple developers to work on different features at the same time.

5. Difference between 'git log' and 'git status':
 - 'git log' shows commit history
 - 'git status' shows the current state of working directory.

6. Find commits where "Vehicle.h" was changed:
 - command used 'git log --oneline -- Vehicle.h'

7. Find commits with "file" in the message:
 - Command: 'git log --grep="file"'

8. OOP concepts
 -Inheritence: Allows one class to inherit the properties of another.
 -Polymorphism: Enables a function to take different forms based on input
 -Encapsulation: Restricts direct acess to object data for security

9. Difference between "Dictator and Lieutenants" and "Integration manager" workflow:
 - In "Dictator and Lieutenants", the dicator has the final authority over the merges, while in integration manager the manager reviews and integrates changes.

10. Benefits of Dictator and Lieutenants for a large team:
 - Ensures better code review and structered merging process.
 - Reduces conflicts in large-scale collaborative projects.
